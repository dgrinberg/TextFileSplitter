# TextFileSplitter

A small utility windows application, written in C#, that will split a text file based on a character.

Enter:
  Filepath
  split character
  Output location
  Ouput extension

The application will then split the text up into chunks, saving those chunks as separate files within the output directory. The output filename format is output_{file#}.{extension}.
